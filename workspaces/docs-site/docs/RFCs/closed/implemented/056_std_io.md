## Summary

This RFC introduces `std.io` as Incan's in-memory binary I/O module. Its core abstraction is `BytesIO`, a writable and seekable byte stream over an in-memory `bytes` buffer for binary parsing, protocol work, fixtures, and transformation pipelines that should not depend on filesystem paths. The user-facing shape is intentionally recognizable to Python users coming from `io.BytesIO`, while the underlying semantics also take advantage of Rust's `Cursor` and `BufRead` model where that produces a cleaner complete contract for cursor movement, delimiter-based reads, and exact-width numeric helpers.

## Motivation

Not all binary input starts as a file on disk. Tests, network clients, generated fixtures, embedded assets, decompression stages, and parser pipelines often begin with a `bytes` value that is already in memory. Those users should not need to import `std.fs` or drop into `rust::std::io::Cursor` just to move a cursor, read exact byte counts, skip until a delimiter, or decode fixed-width numbers. `std.io` gives Incan a standard home for that in-memory story while staying separate from path and OS-file concerns. That separation matters for real binary formats: `std.fs` should get bytes into memory or stream them from a file, while `std.io.BytesIO` should make the parsing and re-encoding work itself possible in pure Incan.

## Goals

- Provide a `BytesIO`-like type over `bytes` for in-memory binary parsing and rewriting.
- Standardize cursor, exact-read, delimiter-read, and overwrite semantics so users do not hand-roll slicing logic for every parser.
- Commit to a complete exact-width numeric read and write surface aligned with RFC 009, including both endian families for multi-byte values.
- Keep `std.io` independent from filesystem path APIs; users should be able to parse a `bytes` value without importing `std.fs`.
- Make the pure-Incan binary parsing story strong enough for real format readers such as GGUF-style metadata and tensor-descriptor parsers.

## Non-Goals

- Standardizing filesystem file handles; that belongs to RFC 055.
- Defining async networking or async stream protocols here.
- Mirroring Python's entire `io` hierarchy.
- Introducing spill-to-disk behavior in `BytesIO`; spooled temporary storage belongs in `std.tempfile`, not here.
- Defining general `Reader` / `Writer` protocol families in this RFC.
- Reproducing Rust `Read` / `Seek` / `BufRead` trait names one-to-one as the user-facing surface.

## Guide-level explanation

Authors use `std.io.BytesIO` when they already have a `bytes` value and want to parse or rewrite it incrementally.

```incan
from std.io import BytesIO, Endian

buf = BytesIO(data)
magic = buf.read_exact(4)?
version: u32 = buf.read(Endian.Little)?
metadata_count: u64 = buf.read(Endian.Little)?

nul: u8 = 0
payload = buf.read_until(nul)?
remaining = buf.remaining()
```

`BytesIO` is also writable. It overwrites from the current cursor position unless the caller explicitly seeks elsewhere first.

```incan
from std.io import BytesIO, Endian

out = BytesIO()
out.write(b"GGUF")?
version: u32 = 3
metadata_count: u64 = 42
out.write(version, Endian.Little)?
out.write(metadata_count, Endian.Little)?

blob = out.into_bytes()
```

The mental model is: `std.fs` gets bytes into or out of files, while `std.io` walks through and rewrites bytes already in memory.

## Reference-level explanation

### Module split and compatibility target

- The standard library must expose `std.io` for in-memory byte-stream reading, writing, and cursor semantics.
- `std.io` is deliberately separate from `std.fs`: open OS-file handles belong to the filesystem module, while `BytesIO` operates on already-materialized `bytes`.
- The surface should be recognizable to Python users coming from `io.BytesIO`, but the committed contract is broader than Python's minimal cursor methods because Incan also standardizes explicit numeric parsing helpers.
- The committed numeric helper surface depends on RFC 009. Width-specific reads and writes must use the sized numeric vocabulary introduced there.
- Implementations may use Rust `std::io::Cursor`, `BufRead`, and primitive byte-conversion helpers internally, but user-visible semantics are defined by this RFC and stdlib docs, not by Rust trait names.

### Required capabilities (committed contract)

The `std.io` contract commits to the following `BytesIO` surface:

- Direct construction: `BytesIO(initial: bytes = b"") -> BytesIO`.
- Byte reads: `read(size: int = -1) -> Result[bytes, E]`, `read_exact(size: int) -> Result[bytes, E]`.
- Delimiter helpers: `read_until(byte: u8) -> Result[bytes, E]`, `skip_until(byte: u8) -> Result[int, E]`.
- Cursor helpers: `tell() -> int`, `seek(offset: int, whence: int = 0) -> Result[int, E]`, `rewind() -> Result[None, E]`, `seek_relative(offset: int) -> Result[None, E]`.
- Byte writes: `write(data: bytes) -> Result[int, E]`, `truncate(size: int | None = None) -> Result[int, E]`.
- Buffer extraction and inspection: `getvalue() -> bytes`, `into_bytes() -> bytes`, `remaining() -> int`.
- Trait-backed exact-width numeric reads and writes aligned with RFC 009.

### Normative cursor and buffer semantics

Cursor behavior is normative:

- A newly constructed `BytesIO(initial)` starts with its cursor at position `0`.
- `read(size)` must return at most `size` bytes and must advance the cursor by the returned byte count.
- `read(size)` with `size = -1` must return the remaining bytes.
- `read(size)` at EOF must return an empty `bytes` value.
- `read_exact(size)` must fail if fewer than `size` bytes remain.
- `seek(offset, whence)` must follow the Python-style `whence` model: `0` for start, `1` for current position, and `2` for end.
- `rewind()` is the convenience form of seeking to the start of the buffer.
- `seek_relative(offset)` moves relative to the current cursor position and must fail if the resulting position would be invalid.

Write behavior is also normative:

- `BytesIO` is always readable, writable, and seekable; separate `readable()` / `writable()` / `seekable()` predicates are not part of the committed surface.
- `write(data)` writes from the current cursor position. It does not imply append semantics unless the caller has already moved the cursor to the end.
- `write(data)` must either write the full byte slice or fail. Partial-write behavior is not part of the user-visible contract for an in-memory buffer.
- `truncate(size=None)` must shrink or extend the buffer to `size`; when `size` is omitted, it uses the current cursor position.

Delimiter behavior is normative:

- `read_until(byte)` must return bytes up to and including the delimiter when the delimiter is found.
- `read_until(byte)` must return the remaining bytes when EOF is reached before the delimiter.
- `skip_until(byte)` must discard bytes until the delimiter or EOF and return the total number of discarded bytes, including the delimiter when it is found.
- `read_until(byte)` and `skip_until(byte)` must return `0`-length / `0`-count results at EOF.

Buffer extraction behavior is normative:

- `getvalue()` returns a `bytes` snapshot of the buffer contents.
- `into_bytes()` returns the buffer bytes without changing the cursor. Implementations may avoid an extra copy when ownership rules permit it, but callers must not rely on consumption or aliasing behavior.
- `remaining()` returns the number of unread bytes from the current cursor position to the logical end of the buffer.

### Numeric helper surface

The numeric helper surface is committed, not tentative. It is trait-backed rather than a public matrix of dozens of method names:

- `Endian` exposes `Little` and `Big` byte-order variants.
- `BinaryRead[T]` exposes `read(endian: Endian) -> Result[T, E]`.
- `BinaryWrite[T]` exposes `write(value: T, endian: Endian) -> Result[None, E]`.
- `BytesIO` adopts those traits for `u8`, `i8`, `u16`, `i16`, `u32`, `i32`, `u64`, `i64`, `u128`, `i128`, `f32`, and `f64`.
- Reads are selected by expected result type, so callers must provide static type context: `value: u32 = buf.read(Endian.Little)?`.
- Writes are selected by the argument type: `out.write(value_u32, Endian.Little)?`.
- Endianness is ignored for `u8` and `i8`, because byte order is meaningless for one-byte values.
- Convenience overloads for `int` and `float` are intentionally deferred. RFC 009 defines those as ergonomic aliases for `i64` and `f64`, and adding both aliases and exact-width overloads needs a coherent compiler-level alias-overload rule rather than duplicate Rust impls.

### Expected API shape (skeletal)

#### `BytesIO`

- `BytesIO(initial: bytes = b"") -> BytesIO`.
- `read(size: int = -1) -> Result[bytes, E]`.
- `read_exact(size: int) -> Result[bytes, E]`.
- `read_until(byte: u8) -> Result[bytes, E]`.
- `skip_until(byte: u8) -> Result[int, E]`.
- `tell() -> int`.
- `seek(offset: int, whence: int = 0) -> Result[int, E]`.
- `rewind() -> Result[None, E]`.
- `seek_relative(offset: int) -> Result[None, E]`.
- `write(data: bytes) -> Result[int, E]`.
- `truncate(size: int | None = None) -> Result[int, E]`.
- `getvalue() -> bytes`.
- `into_bytes() -> bytes`.
- `remaining() -> int`.
- `BinaryRead[T].read(endian: Endian) -> Result[T, E]`.
- `BinaryWrite[T].write(value: T, endian: Endian) -> Result[None, E]`.

### Errors and compatibility

- Operations must surface failure through ordinary `Result` returns unless a helper is explicitly documented otherwise.
- Error payloads should be actionable, including at minimum the failed operation, the requested size or delimiter where relevant, and the cursor position when that improves debugging.
- This RFC is additive. It does not change existing filesystem or builtin contracts.
- `std.io` helpers must not require `rust::` knowledge in ordinary documentation or examples.
- If RFC 009's sized numeric model changes materially before implementation, the width-specific helper signatures in this RFC must be updated to match that final language contract rather than silently drifting.

## Design details

### Why `std.io` is separate from `std.fs`

`BytesIO` solves a different problem than file handles. It helps when the bytes are already in memory. That includes tests, network payloads, decompressed buffers, and parser stages after a file has already been read. Keeping `std.io` separate avoids turning the filesystem module into a generic "everything binary" bucket.

### Python-shaped surface, Rust-backed semantics

The surface should feel familiar to Python users: `BytesIO(data)`, `read`, `write`, `tell`, `seek`, and `getvalue` are all recognizable from `io.BytesIO`. But the substrate is Rust, and Rust gives a few extra semantics that are worth standardizing instead of hiding.

Rust's `Cursor` model is the reason `BytesIO` should be treated as a real writable stream instead of a read-only parser shim. A new cursor starts at the beginning, not the end, and writes overwrite from the current cursor position rather than implying append behavior. Rust also makes `rewind()` and `seek_relative(...)` natural convenience operations, so Incan should expose them instead of forcing callers to encode every cursor move through raw `seek(...)` calls.

Rust's `BufRead` model also gives a strong case for delimiter-based helpers. `read_until` and `skip_until` are not esoteric parser machinery; they are the simple, direct way to handle NUL-terminated strings, line-like records, or bounded marker scans inside binary formats. They belong in a real in-memory binary I/O contract.

### Why the numeric helper surface is broad

Once `std.io` commits to exact-width numeric parsing, arbitrary seams become harder to defend. Supporting only little-endian reads or only a couple of widths would leave the API lopsided for no principled reason. The Rust substrate already supports endian-aware conversion for the full sized-integer and sized-float family, and RFC 009 already defines that vocabulary at the language level. The coherent design is therefore: full width family, both endian families for multi-byte values, and matching read/write overloads.

The default `int` and `float` aliases do still matter ergonomically, but this RFC does not add separate alias overloads. They should be added only after the compiler has a clear rule for alias overloads that does not duplicate emitted Rust trait impls for `i64` and `f64`.

### Why `getbuffer()` and generic protocols stay out

Python's `BytesIO.getbuffer()` exposes a mutable view over the underlying buffer. That is powerful, but it also introduces aliasing and resize constraints that are not worth standardizing before Incan has a broader borrowed-buffer story. This RFC therefore keeps the safe extraction surface small: `getvalue()` for a snapshot and `into_bytes()` for retrieving bytes without exposing mutable buffer aliases.

The same boundary applies to general `Reader` / `Writer` protocols. Those may well make sense later for `BytesIO`, `std.fs.File`, temporary files, network bodies, or query adapters. But that is a cross-cutting stream-abstraction RFC, not part of the in-memory byte-stream contract itself. RFC 056 should finish the concrete `BytesIO` design rather than smuggling in a second library proposal.

### Interaction with temporary storage

Spill-to-disk behavior does not belong in `BytesIO`. Python puts that concept in `tempfile.SpooledTemporaryFile`, not in `io.BytesIO`, and Incan keeps the same separation. RFC 056 is about pure in-memory streams; RFC 010 standardizes spooled temporary files in `std.tempfile`, aligned with `BytesIO` where practical without defining `BytesIO` as a magical disk-spilling stream.

## Alternatives considered

1. **No `std.io`; use slicing and builtins only** — too low-level and repetitive for real parsers.
2. **Fold `BytesIO` into `std.fs`** — rejected because in-memory byte streams are not path-based filesystem APIs.
3. **Expose only a Rust-shaped `Cursor` API** — exposes substrate vocabulary instead of an Incan-facing contract.
4. **Require separate `struct`-style unpacking for every numeric read and write** — workable, but worse ergonomically for the common fixed-width cases.
5. **Include spill-to-disk behavior directly in `BytesIO`** — rejected because storage policy and tempfile lifecycle are separate concerns better handled in `std.tempfile`.

## Drawbacks

- `std.io` is a modest but real additional stdlib surface to maintain.
- The full numeric helper family creates a larger testing matrix than a tiny parser-only API would.
- Excluding buffer-view APIs means some zero-copy workflows will still need Rust interop or a later dedicated buffer abstraction.

## Implementation architecture

*(Non-normative.)* A practical delivery implements `BytesIO` as a normal Incan stdlib type backed by Rust cursor and buffer primitives, with exact-width conversions delegated to Rust's primitive byte-conversion helpers. The public API should stay Incan-first even when the runtime maps directly onto `Cursor<Vec<u8>>`-like semantics underneath.

## Implementation plan

1. **Stdlib module and registry wiring** — Add `std.io` to the stdlib namespace registry and implement `BytesIO` as an authored stdlib module using direct Rust interop, following the `std.fs` layout rather than adding a custom Rust extern shim.
2. **Core byte and cursor behavior** — Implement construction, `read`, `read_exact`, `read_until`, `skip_until`, `tell`, `seek`, `rewind`, `seek_relative`, `write`, `truncate`, `getvalue`, `into_bytes`, and `remaining` with the normative cursor and buffer semantics above.
3. **Numeric helper family** — Implement the RFC 009-aligned trait-backed exact-width read/write overloads, including endian variants.
4. **Tests and snapshots** — Add focused compile/run coverage for the stdlib module, cursor movement, EOF behavior, delimiter behavior, overwrite semantics, truncation, and numeric round trips. Add codegen or stdlib loader coverage where registry wiring can regress silently.
5. **User-facing docs and versioning** — Add a curated `std.io` reference page, update stdlib navigation and release notes, regenerate generated language reference data when registry output changes, and bump the active development version for the implementation.

## Layers affected

- **Stdlib / runtime (`incan_stdlib`)**: new `std.io` module and the `BytesIO` type.
- **Language surface**: the module, constructor, and methods must be available as specified.
- **Builtin numeric surface**: numeric helper signatures depend on RFC 009's sized numeric types and aliases.
- **LSP / tooling**: completions and hovers for `std.io`.
- **Docs / examples**: binary parsing examples should use `std.io.BytesIO` instead of `rust::` recipes for the common in-memory path.

## Design Decisions

- `BytesIO` uses direct construction: `BytesIO(data)`, not `BytesIO.new(data)`.
- `BytesIO` is a writable, seekable, in-memory binary stream rather than a read-only parser cursor.
- The committed contract includes `read_until`, `skip_until`, `rewind`, `seek_relative`, `truncate`, `getvalue`, `into_bytes`, and `remaining`.
- Numeric overloads cover the full RFC 009 width family, with both endian families for multi-byte values and matching write helpers.
- Convenience overloads for `int` and `float` are deferred until alias overload emission has a compiler-level rule.
- `BytesIO` does not include `close()`, `getbuffer()`, spill-to-disk behavior, or generic `Reader` / `Writer` protocols.
