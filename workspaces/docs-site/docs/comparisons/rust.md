# Incan vs Rust

Rust is the right answer when low-level control, performance predictability, and ecosystem maturity matter more than authoring speed. Incan does not replace Rust. The current beta builds through Cargo/rustc, and the longer-lived product boundary is high-level application code that can produce native artifacts and interoperate with the Rust ecosystem.

Choose Incan when the code is mostly application logic and the Rust version would be more ceremony than signal.

## Where Rust wins

- Low-level systems programming.
- Precise ownership, borrowing, lifetime, and memory-layout control.
- Mature crate ecosystem and tooling.
- Libraries that need to expose a stable Rust API.
- Performance-sensitive internals where every abstraction boundary matters.

## Where Incan is trying to win

- Python-readable business, workflow, data, CLI, and service logic.
- Strong domain models without Rust-level boilerplate at every call site.
- Explicit `Result` / `Option` handling without making every application module feel like systems code.
- Rust interop for the smaller parts of the program that need real Rust APIs or crates.
- Faster iteration for teams that like Rust's guarantees but not Rust's surface area for everyday code.

## The honest tradeoff

Rust is more mature, more explicit, and more powerful. Incan deliberately gives up some low-level control to make high-level code smaller and easier to scan.

That tradeoff is only worth it when the output is application-shaped. If the code is a runtime, database engine, kernel, allocator, compiler backend, or heavily optimized crate, write Rust.

## Decision guide

| Use Rust when... | Use Incan when... |
| --- | --- |
| You need precise memory and lifetime control. | You need clear application logic with native output. |
| You are publishing a Rust crate API. | You are building a CLI, service, workflow, or app layer. |
| Runtime internals dominate the code. | Domain rules and orchestration dominate the code. |
| Every allocation and abstraction boundary matters. | Readability and reviewability matter most. |
