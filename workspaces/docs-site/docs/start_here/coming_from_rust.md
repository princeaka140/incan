# Coming from Rust (evaluator)

This page routes Rust-first evaluators who want to understand where Incan keeps Rust-shaped semantics and where it trades surface syntax for application-code ergonomics.

## Install first

If you already use Cargo and want a source-built compiler, install the release source directly from Git with the LSP feature enabled so both `incan` and `incan-lsp` are installed:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/encero-systems/incan.git --tag v0.4.0 --locked --features lsp --bin incan --bin incan-lsp
incan --version
incan-lsp --version
```

If you want the faster binary toolchain path instead, use the release installer. This path can also bootstrap the stable Rust backend through `rustup` on a fresh machine:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/encero-systems/incan/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
incan --version
incan-lsp --version
```

After installation, create a project and run the normal first-contact loop:

```bash
incan new hello --yes
cd hello
incan run
incan test
incan build --release
```

    - [Roadmap](../roadmap.md)

## What to look for

- Clear boundaries: what exists today vs roadmap (especially for WASM/frontend)
- “Stable vs experimental” labeling without forcing you to read RFCs first
- Rust-shaped `Result` composition: Incan keeps `map`, `map_err`, `and_then`, `or_else`, `inspect`, and `inspect_err` rather than adding Python-style aliases, with callable arguments documented as `Callable[...]`
